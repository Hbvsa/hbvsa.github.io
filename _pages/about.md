# Selected Experience
## Education Background

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisboa. 

Coursework included advanced topics in machine learning and artificial intelligence:
- Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning and Markov Decision Processes
- Artificial Intelligence in Games
- Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
- Natural Language Processing

## Master Thesis - Deep Learning project to extract correlation between genetic factors and disease

For my master thesis I implementated a deep learning model to extract correlations between genetic information and diseases in datasets with low feature-target correlation. In some datasets, each individual feature shows no correlation with the target variable when considered in isolation. However, the correlation emerges only through non-linear interactions among multiple features. This characteristic makes the problem particularly challenging to model. Check [Master Thesis](https://hbvsa.github.io/master_thesis/) for more information.

## Deep learning projects

I have implemented and applied various deep learning models across multiple projects. 
One such end-to-end project being the "Dino Custom Object Detection" being displayed at [Portfolio](https://hbvsa.github.io/portfolio/). 
I have also deployed these models with Docker to different cloud providers such as GCP, AWS, Azure and HuggingFace to make sure the model capabilities can be shared and easy to use in an app format.

### Latest deep learning techniques
The portfolio section also serves as a library to dump educational posts/tutorials of the latest techniques or models in the deep learning literature that I have reviewed.
