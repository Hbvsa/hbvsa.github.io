# Selected Experience
## Education Background

I have a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisboa, during which I studied machine learning and artificial intelligence topics in multiple courses such as Data Science, Machine Learning, PLIDM (Planning, Learning and Intelligent Decision Making) basically Reinforcement Learning and Markov Decision Processes, Artificial Intelligence in Games, Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, and Natural Language Processing. I have also completed a [online course](https://coursera.org/share/3a02f88e77a05ca31ecbe596b30a2ccf) which I recommend for anyone wanting to get a good understanding of the math behind machine learning.

## Master Thesis
The motivation for my thesis starts by understanding that the correlation between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and a disease may hinge on a strictly
nonlinear combination of two or three SNPs, among the hundreds present in a dataset, which poses a challenge for
traditional statistical methods since analyzing individual SNPs might yield zero correlation with the disease. The
correlations can only be accurately assessed when SNPs are considered in combination and given the exponential
increase in the number of combinations as the number of SNPs rises, the developed model provides a valuable
alternative to exhaustive methods.

The solution was the implementation of a deep learning classification model for extracting correlations between genetic information
and diseases. Following the model training, the learned weights were employed to emphasize the most significant
SNPs. The features identified as significant by the model underwent a subsequent filtration process using a
chi-square test. In datasets where the impact of SNPs contributed merely 1% to the variation in the probability of
disease for the samples, the model exhibited its capability to accurately identify the pertinent combination of
significant SNPs, despite the subtle nature of the correlation. The model was able to outperform the state of the
art non exhaustive solutions/models.
