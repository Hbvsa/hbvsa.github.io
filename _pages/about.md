# Selected Experience
## Education Background

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, Lisboa. 

Coursework included advanced topics in machine learning and artificial intelligence:
- Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning and Markov Decision Processes
- Artificial Intelligence in Games
- Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
- Natural Language Processing

## Master Thesis - Deep Learning project to extract correlation between genetic factors and disease

For my master thesis I implementated a deep learning model to extract correlations between genetic information and diseases in datasets with low feature-target correlation. In some datasets, each individual feature shows no correlation with the target variable when considered in isolation. However, the correlation emerges only through non-linear interactions among multiple features. This characteristic makes the problem particularly challenging to model. Check [Master Thesis](https://hbvsa.github.io/master_thesis/) for more information.

## Deep learning projects

I have implemented and applied various deep learning models across multiple projects. One such project being displayed at [Portfolio](https://hbvsa.github.io/portfolio/) along side some educational posts showing the latest techniques used for LLMs such as RAG. 
I have also deployed these models with Docker to different cloud providers such as GCP, AWS, Azure and HuggingFace to make sure the model capabilities can be shared and easy to use in an app format.
